+Code the following app
+```
+Create a fun addictive rhythm based workout game called REP MASTER with these exact specifications.
+GAME CONCEPT: Exercise names flash on screen one at a time like PUSH-UP, SQUAT, BURPEE etc. Player must click or tap the button within the time limit to complete the rep. Build combo streaks for higher scores. Fast paced tests reflexes and reaction time.
+GAME FLOW: Start screen with title REP MASTER and subtitle Match the exercise prompts! Build your combo! Click START WORKOUT button to begin. Game runs for 45 seconds. Random exercise name appears in center of screen. Player has 1.2 seconds to click the exercise button before it disappears. New exercise appears immediately after successful or missed. After 45 seconds show final score and stats.
+EXERCISE LIST randomly choose from these: PUSH-UP, SQUAT, BURPEE, PLANK, JUMPING JACK, LUNGE, CRUNCH, MOUNTAIN CLIMBER, HIGH KNEES, PULL-UP.
+CONTROLS: Large button appears below the exercise name. Button shows the same exercise name, for example if SQUAT appears button says SQUAT. Click or tap the button to complete the rep. Works on both desktop with mouse click and mobile with touch.
+SCORING SYSTEM: Hit on time equals plus 10 points. Hit builds combo streak 1x, 2x, 3x up to 10x multiplier. Score equals base points times combo multiplier. Example 5th hit in a row equals 10 points times 5 equals 50 points that rep. Miss equals combo resets to 0x and no points earned. Display current combo prominently.
+VISUAL FEEDBACK: When you HIT successfully the button flashes green, show plus points animation like plus 50, play success sound if possible, combo counter increases visibly. When you MISS meaning time runs out the button flashes red briefly or shows MISS, show COMBO BROKEN message, combo resets to 0, play miss or buzzer sound if possible.
+TIMER URGENCY VISUAL: Each exercise has a shrinking progress bar or countdown circle for 1.2 seconds. Bar fills up or circle shrinks to show time remaining. Visual urgency helps player react faster. When time is almost up in last 0.3 seconds progress bar turns red.
+UI LAYOUT: TOP SECTION shows Timer like Time 38s counting down from 45 to 0, Score like Score 420, Combo like Combo 7x with fire emoji when combo above 5. CENTER SECTION is main gameplay area with large text showing current exercise name like SQUAT, progress bar or circle showing time remaining for this rep, large obvious button below to click. BOTTOM SECTION has motivational text that changes: KEEP IT UP when combo 1 to 3, YOU'RE ON FIRE when combo 4 to 7, BEAST MODE when combo 8 to 10, UNSTOPPABLE when combo 10 plus.
+GAME OVER SCREEN after 45 seconds: WORKOUT COMPLETE title. Final Score with number. Total Reps Hit showing number out of total attempts. Accuracy showing percentage. Best Combo showing number with x. High Score showing number and save best score ever. Two buttons TRAIN AGAIN and REST where rest goes back to start screen.
+DIFFICULTY PACING: First 15 seconds has 1.2 second window for easier warmup. 15 to 30 seconds has 1.0 second window for medium difficulty. 30 to 45 seconds has 0.8 second window for hard final push. This creates natural progression and intensity.
+VISUAL DESIGN: Use gym fitness theme colors like black red yellow orange. Bold easy to read fonts in uppercase with high contrast. Exercise names should be huge and impossible to miss. Button should be large and easy to click in panic. Clean minimal design with no distractions.
+SOUND EFFECTS if possible: Click sound when hitting rep like ding or beep. Miss sound when time runs out like buzzer. Combo milestone sounds at 5x and 10x. Whistle sound when game ends. If sounds not available visual feedback is enough.
+MOTIVATIONAL TOUCHES: Show encouraging gym slang like LIGHTWEIGHT BABY when combo hits 5, ONE MORE REP when timer below 10 seconds, NO PAIN NO GAIN when you miss. Keep it energetic and hype.
+TECHNICAL REQUIREMENTS: Responsive works on phone and desktop. Accurate timing where 1.2 seconds should actually be 1.2 seconds. Fast response to clicks with no lag. Save high score to browser storage. Smooth animations with no janky transitions. Random exercise selection with no predictable patterns.
+ESSENTIAL FEATURES must have: 45 second timed game. Random exercise prompts. Clickable button with time limit. Combo system that resets on miss. Score accumulation with multipliers. Game over screen with stats. Restart functionality. High score tracking.
+NICE TO HAVE if time allows: Leaderboard local only showing top 5 scores. Different difficulty modes like Easy Medium Hard. Workout stats over time showing total reps all time. Share score feature. Background music toggle.
+Make it feel fast paced exciting and addictive. The game should make players want to beat their high score immediately. Prioritize snappy responsive gameplay over fancy graphics.

+Fix all build errors. Simplify the game. Make a working button clicking game where exercise names appear on screen and player clicks a button to score points. 45 second timer. Show score. Keep it very simple.
+If that doesn't work, try an even more basic version:
+Create a simple clicker game. Show random exercise names like PUSH-UP or SQUAT. Player clicks a big button to score 10 points. Game lasts 30 seconds. Show final score at end.
+If it STILL fails, go super minimal:
+Make a basic button clicking game. Click button to add points. 30 second timer. Show score.
+The key is to get SOMETHING working first, then add features one at a time. Once you have a working basic game, you can say things like:
+Add combo system where consecutive clicks multiply score
+or
+Make exercise names appear randomly from a list
+or
+Add game over screen with restart button
